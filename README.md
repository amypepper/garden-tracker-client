## Summary

This front-end client was created to demonstrate my skills in full stack development. It is built using React and works with a RESTful API on the back end that I developed using PostgreSQL and NodeJS. I have used React Router to give the user a better experience navigating around the app in their browser.

This app allows users to create categories of gardening activities, which will allow them to organize the activities that they want to document. Users can record the date completed, time of day completed, and any notes about the plant(s) they were caring for. All categories and activities can be deleted, and new ones can be added at any time.

You will be able to better care for your plants since you will know exactly the last time you watered, pruned, weeded, or fed them. Happy growing!
